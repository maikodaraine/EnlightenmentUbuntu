Elemines is an EFL minesweeper clone.

Rules:
------

The object of the game is to clear an abstract minefield without detonating a
mine. The game is played by revealing squares of the grid, by clicking them 
with a mouse. If a square containing a mine is revealed, you lose the game. 
Otherwise, a digit is revealed in the square, indicating  the number of 
adjacent squares that contain mines.


How to play:
------------

Left click to uncover a tile
Right to add/remove a flag
Middle click to clear around once the correct number of mines have been flagged.


Configuration:
--------------

On the command line, you can change the number of mines in the field with the
-m option. Default is 12. The board is 10x10 so mine limit is 99. You can
change the mines in the game by clicking on the 'Config.' button.

An alternate default-big theme is available, with twice more bombes and tiles:

  $ elemines -t=default-big


Scoring:
--------

Score is based on the mine number and the time to complete the task. It's
compute like (board_size * mines - time). There are two categories for scores:
'Standard' if you played using the default mine number of 12, and 'Custom' for
the other cases.


Sound:
------

To have sound in elemines, your EFL must have been compiled with sound support.
