Elev8 Module for E17
--------------------

This is a proof of concept module that will let you have E17 gadgets written
in JavaScript, using the Elev8 API. It works to the extent that one can
create gadgets using Elementary widgets and create menu entries, and use
Elev8 modules, such as D-Bus and storage.


BUILDING

You'll need a recent version of Elev8 (specially its Elementary module).



USING

Set ELEV8_MODPATH to point to the path of your Elev8 module installation
directory before launching Enlightenment.

Copy test-gadget.js to /tmp.

Load the Elev8 module in Settings->Modules. Accept that it is not a standard
module and that it might be unstable.

Loading the module will scan the /tmp directory (currently hardcoded!) for
'*.js' files, and create a new gadget class for each gadget. When the module
is loaded, one can just add them to the shelves or desktop directly, by
choosing the file name as the module name (e.g. 'test-gadget.js').
