Questions that are still there:

 - 1 vs. N config file(s)? The latter would either need changes to connman's .service file or entire write access to /var/lib/connman. Both of which aren't really desireable
 - integrate modes guessing into econnman vs. standalone app?
 - remember passwords in files or some keyring?
