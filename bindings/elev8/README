V8 javascript based runtime for EFL for rapid app development

elev8 is a javascript based runtime, based on Google(TM) v8 javascript engine.
The purpose of EFL is to ease the process of app creation for EFL.

EFL is a vast collection of libraries that perform tasks, including, but not limited to :
1. Window Management
2. Manage I/O devices
3. Networking
4. File Management
5. Audio/Video
6. Runtime data manipulation
