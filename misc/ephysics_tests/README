Requirements:
-------------

Must:
  libc
  ecore (at least 1.7.99)
  evas (at least 1.7.99)
  bullet (at least 2.80)
  elementary (at least 1.7.99)
  ephysics (at least 1.7.99)

EPhysics Tests provides many tests for ephysics. It consists of three
binaries:
 * ephysics_test (a test suite)
 * ephysics_sandbox (util for testing physics attributes and actions)
 * ephysics_logo (example of fancy program logo using ephysics)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPILING AND INSTALLING:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
(as root unless you are installing in your users directories):
  $ make install

If elementary is installed, it will build and install a test application as
well, that showcases EPhysics capabilites. Run

  $ ephysics_test

to see these examples.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TESTS

Tests require elementary to be build.

List of test applications:
 * ephysics_test => List with many tests to exemplify specific features
 * ephysics_logo => Example of logo / loading screen made using ephysics
 * ephysics_sandbox => Application to set many different properties to bodies
                       and see they interacting.

ephysics_test supports to launch a specified test on command line, like

 $ ephysics_test "Jumping Balls"

Also, it can run only the test, avoiding the main menu, with parameter
--test-win-only or -to (it must to be passed before the test name):

 $ ephysics_test -to Camera

The other programs don't accept parameters.
